# Cryptography
Based on my own interest in cryptography after having read Neil Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon" and reading "The Code Breakers"
by David Kahn, here I have a bunch of codes that encode in python a number of the ciphers I have read about. In future I will probably try out new ciphers, and perhaps make some attempt at writing some cryptoanalysis tools.
